# Heart-Stroke-Prediction 

In this project, an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on a heart stroke dataset to clean and prepare the data, identifying key patterns, correlations, and handling missing values. Several machine learning algorithms were employed, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and K-means Clustering, to predict the likelihood of heart strokes based on various health indicators and lifestyle factors. A 5-fold cross-validation strategy was applied to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models, minimizing overfitting. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix metrics. Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using grid search to optimize the models for better accuracy. Feature scaling, categorical variable encoding, and feature selection techniques were also implemented to improve model efficiency. The project ultimately provided valuable insights into the most significant factors contributing to stroke risk, enabling more accurate predictions and supporting potential health interventions.
